If you are looking for a 'desktop seek feature' from what's already in the final mix, that remote control would not be available anytime soon. If you are trying to mix from desktop while wearing HMD, that might be something we'd consider supporting.",

We have removed the Cardboard version of G'Player from the G'Audio website and from the Google Play Store. \n\nWe will be focusing on supporting the Gear VR version of G'Player moving forward. To install and activate that version of G\u00e2\u0080\u0099Player from the Oculus store, you need to get a redemption code from our website. Simply sign in to your G'Audio account (or sign up if you haven't already) and click on the \"Gear VR G'Player Download\" button that can be found at the bottom of the page at https://www.gaudiolab.com/gaudiosol. \n\nThere you can find all the instructions you need to get started along with your redemption code. Of course, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions!"

(And doing something productive at the same time...)\n\nFor those of you who don't know, MDR is our Music and Dance Revue (essentially an amazing staff talent show) that we put on every Monday night at the amphitheater.  Performances cover all kinds of talent including playing musical instruments, comedic routines, dancing, musical theater, and everything in between!\n\nClee posted a great one by Klau down below in the other post, but if you want to get more ideas, it's really easy to Youtube \"Bruin Woods MDR\" and stuff will come up!  If you have any other questions or want help developing your performance, please feel free to message myself or @[503422899:2048:Vergel] or really anybody who has done it in the past.  \n\nHappy procrastinating!\n-D\u00c3\u00b6dge \n\nP.S. Just another one to get ya started: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TCJ_u8j_zE"

          "post": "At the beginning of each 3-hour morale shift, the room de\u00cc\u0081cor, music, and costumes will change and a fresh group of enthusiastic moralers will flood the dance floor. During each shift, there will be costume contests. Each Dancer Captain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Color Team will be competing for the BEST and MOST costumes. Below are all the shift subthemes to plan your costumes accordingly!\n\n12pm-3pm Bright Lights, Big City\nStart off the theme shifts with an illuminating trip around the world. From Sin City to the Holy City, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to spread our fight for the cause to every corner of the globe, so grab your most badass beret, or your classiest kimono, and let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s come out in style for this celebration of cultures. Whether you want to be bold and British, risque\u00cc\u0081 and Russian, or sexy and Spanish, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s represent every city and country with our commitment to the fight against Pediatric AIDS. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a worldwide problem, but together, as one people, we can eradicate it.\n\n3pm-6pm Spotlight\nThis is your chance to ignite your alter ego and become the star you truly are. Whether you rep the \u00e2\u0080\u009cSingle Ladies\u00e2\u0080\u009d like Beyonce\u00cc\u0081 or you can bend it like Beckham, stardom is calling your name. For these 3 hours revel in the glory of fame and release your Sasha Fierce (swagger) because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your one chance to be a celebrity. What better time is there to take center stage than in the fight against AIDS and become the face of this great cause?! Prepare your accep- tance speeches ladies and gentlemen because you may be in the running for the award of Best Featured Dancer. Under the spotlight there can only be one, will it be you?\n\n6 pm-9pm Friday Night Lights\nClear eyes, full hearts, CAN\u00e2\u0080\u0099T LOSE! Great moments are born out of great opportunity and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what we have here right now ladies and gentleman. Time to bring out everything you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got; everything athletic that is. The crowd is pumped, the lights are bright, and the moment is ready for the taking! Sport (get it!?) the most athletic attire that you have whether that means bringing out the pom-poms, unveiling that jersey you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve hidden for so long, dressing up as your favorite athlete, or even rocking John Wooden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s glasses. Just remember one thing: this is Dance Marathon and NO ONE BEATS US ON OUR HOME TURF!\n\n9pm-12am The Twilight Zone\nYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re moving into a land of both shadow and substance, of ghostly things and ghoulish ideas\u00e2\u0080\u0094 you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve just crossed over into...the Twilight Zone. As we dance through our night shift, two-step into another dimension of boogie man boogiers and skeleton shufflers. Throw on those Hal- loween costumes that usually only resurrect once a year (NOT mouse ears and lingerie!) and dance to the most twisted \u00e2\u0080\u009cTwist and Shout\u00e2\u0080\u009d of your afterlife. Dress as a devilish demon, vi- cious vampire (...not Edward), or zany zombie, and be ready to groove in a graveyard and scare away stigma.\n\n12am-3am Let There Be Bright\nImagine getting tased and hit by lightning at the same time. Now think of going skydiving and realizing your parachute is broken and you are all scared and stuff but then you fix it and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re like \u00e2\u0080\u009cwoah! Close call!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and then as you float safely to the ground you find a hundred dollars in your pocket. If the mental and physical aspects of those two experiences could somehow mesh into one three-hour chunk of time, it would be this shift. There is little you can do to prepare yourself for the sheer carnage and energy of this shift. Let there be Bright, people. Let there be Bright. Bring forth your brightest and your tightest. Pierce the dim light of AGB with your neon, your spandex, and maybe even those Velcro shoes from the nineties that light up every time you take a step. Let the hazy collective glow of our clothing seep from the doors and windows of the ballroom and let those outside know that for those three shining hours, we brought light to a place where there once hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been, and with it hope to those who once had none.\n\n3am-6am Night Light\nSHIFT THEMES\nLullaby...and goodnight....go to sleep...WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, wait a sec. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go to sleep when there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plenty of dance moves to show off. Hop into your finest pair of jammies and say goodnight to Pediatric AIDS. Better turn that night light on because Ackerman is about to turn into a full-fledged slumber party! Ever wished that it was still socially acceptable to rock out in those onsie pajamas in the back of your closet that your Great Aunt Marjorie got for you for your 18th birthday? Yup, thought so! Now it is. This is your chance to relive those cherished childhood memories. Except, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no crying to your mama. Just dancing...only dancing.\n\n6am-9am Red, Light & Blue\nOhhhhh say can you see, by the dawn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s early light!! As we open the curtains of the ballroom and let the sun shine in, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time to show that country pride and bring out all that Red, Light, and BLUE! We are the home of the brave, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time to prove it! Get ready for a guest ap- pearance from Mr. President himself! Just kidding, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not coming, but that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean you still can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t dress to impress! Pull out all the stops with the most creative costumes; sparkly fireworks, a big American flag, Stagecoach regulars, Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter, you name it. Show your loyalty to the land of the free and home of the Dance Marathon. \u00e2\u0080\u0098MERICA!\n\n9am-10:30 am Lumos\nBlast through platform 9 3\u00e2\u0081\u00844 and into the land all things magical. Mount your dragons and jump aboard the Hogwarts Express because were gearing up for the duel of the century. Hobbits, mermaids, witches, centaurs, and mythical creatures galore are apparating from around the mythical world to stand up to pediatric AIDS. Can you say Avada Kedavra? No sense in packing light for this adventure because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be voyaging from the siren infested waters of the Atlantic to the land of the wildlings and beyond the wall. Your remembrall is sure to not let you forget this battle, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be preciousssss (Gollum voice).\n\n10:30 am- 1pm Bruin Pride\nThink back to the campus tour you took as a senior in high school, when your tour guide non- chalantly mentioned something called Dance Marathon somewhere between how cool it was that Old School was filmed in Kerckhoff and how they love to hang out by Jans Steps and go slacklining. Back then Dance Marathon was just a passing thought, just another of the million things to do at this crazy, gigantic school. Fast forward to today: It seems pretty much agreed that it is a good time to be a Bruin. With new Pauley killing it and varsity athletics that are actually competitive, our beautiful campus is feeling more alive than ever before. The squir- rels are less aggressive, the Peace Sign guy is gone, and there have never been so many ins- tagrams of Royce quad. Put simply, this campus is something to be proud of. Fast Forward to Dance Marathon: After 25 hours of non stop Pediatric AIDS killing dance floor action it may be safe to assume that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need something special to put that extra pep in your step, and for that we are going to call upon everything we love about this campus and this school. Ev- erything that makes this place the best school on earth. For this final shift join your fellow Bruins in wearing your bluest and goldest threads and let the collective Bruin Spirit help you complete the most rewarding 26 hours you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll ever have.\n\n12PM \u00e2\u0080\u0093 1PM: POWER HOUR\nPower Hour! Pump it up Bruins as we power through the last hour! Sport that Blue and Gold while you shake it like Joe Bruin as we show this global pandemic what an 8-clap is really all about. UCLA Fight! Fight! Fight!"

BLOCK:\n\nSo apparently some of you were A LITTLE confused about my last message (have no idea why), so hopefully this one will help clarify.  I'll try to keep it short and sweet:\n\nThis Friday is UCLA's Homecoming Rally.  Dylan wants all of us to go in order to get people excited about recruitment and BW even this early in the school year.\n\nSsooooo... I have 40 tickets for the Rally and Pauley events.  We will be assembling at Red Roebling at around 5:30 for some pre-kooking activities, then getting to the event at 5:30 for lots of fun times (at which we will be MAD HYPE and wreck everyone).\n\nAfter thatttttt... We will be going back to Red Roebs to celebrate the birthday of one beautiful @[515660409:2048:Ben Babies Davies] in proper BDubz form. (<3 U 69 Roommie)\n\nAttire:  We should all be matching, and as of now I think the only way for that to work is for us to wear our staff shirts (I know it's kinda weird but Dyl wants us all matching and I don't think we have enough recruiting shirts left over from last year?)\n\nPlease like this if you can go so I know to get more tickets if need be, and hit me up if you have any questions...\n\nCannot wait to see you all together again (fuck you @[1043010649:2048:Rob], but not the other abroad people) and LET\"S DO IT BIG!!!\n\nFrom the office of the chancellor,\n#partyblock"

For those of you who haven't donated yet, I understand that this may not be the best time for giving money but...\n\n1350 children die everyday from an AIDS-related illness and an additional 1000 are newly infected every day. The AIDS pandemic is the issue of our generation, and it is up to us to take a stand.  With a donation of just $8 you can provide a life-saving vaccine to infants at risk of acquiring the disease from their mothers. So please, the event is Saturday, please take a moment to make a donation, no matter how small, every bit helps save lives!"
