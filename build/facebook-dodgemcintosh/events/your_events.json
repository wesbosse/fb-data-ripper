      "description": "Los Angeles resident Dodge McIntosh turns 25 this Sunday, marking the first time ever in his life he will be doing so. When asked how he wants to celebrate, Dodge was quoted as saying, \"All I wanna do is climb a dope ass mountain then eat way too much CATERED Chipotle and hopefully not diarrhea right when I'm the Chancellor during Secret Hitler,\" a statement which was confusing to many, but surprising to no one.\n\nBut real talk, it is my birthday this weekend and I would love to ring it in with all of you! The plan as of now is as follows:\n\n- Wake up early(ish) on Sunday and knock out an EPIC local hike (actual trail TBD). Take advantage of @[766820261:2048:Kyle Lau] joining us and providing his $1000 photography service for free. #newprofpicsforall\n- Grab some In-n-Out on the way back then PTFO at respective residences.\n- Wake up again and enjoy some catered Chipotle and drinks at our apartment courtesy of @[100000543785165:2048:Kevin Carlson] and his noble efforts surrounding Chiptopia this past summer. (Look it up if you don't know what it is).\n- Depending on the number of people, play at least one v formal group game. If we have 10 or less it will be Secret Hitler and if we have more than 10 I'm thinking big Mafia game. There will be boozes but also feel free to bring some additional ones / your own, Drink Dr. @[533555631:2048:Katie Moffa] will be mixing those VOKKA SODAS all evening.\n\nPlease feel free to throw out hike suggestions and ask questions. If I forgot to invite somebody it's probably fine if they come UGH I GUESS. Obviously, S.O.'s and hopeful S.O.'s are welcome ;)\n\nIf you can only join for one part or the other that's totally fine, hope to see you all soon!"

      "description": "Yeah! Bar puns! Just one of the many things you're going to miss from me over the next three to four months. So come get your fill of bad bar puns, cheap beers ($11 pitchers), and good times one last time tonight at Philly West.\n\nThis is the last night I'll be going out before I take off on the PCT and I'd really love to see you all if you can find the time, even if it's just swinging by for a few. We'll be leaving Apartment Mayonnaise and walking to this fine establishment (local dive bar) to take it over around 8:30, so feel free to join us around then or be totally irrelevant to me all summer HAHAHAH JK LOLZ PLZ COME\n\nAdded incentives include, but are not limited to: delicious philly cheesesteaks, 24-hour Del Taco, 24-hour Jack in the Box, 24-hour FatBurger, late night taco truck, etc., etc.\n\nFeel free to invite anybody I've forgotten who would also enjoy all of the above activities!"

As many of you know, this weekend will be my last full weekend in the Bay Area before I move back down to the Whale's Vagina.\n\nAs such, the gentlemen of 1880 Page have graciously offered to throw a going away party THIS Saturday night at their snappa court.\n\nSo come on over, COME ALIVE, wiggle wiggle with us, and let's get W\u00c3\u00a4sted!! Would love to see everyone who has made my time up here incredible, so I'd better see you there."
